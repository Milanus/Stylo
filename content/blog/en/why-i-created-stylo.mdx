Anyone who has ever needed to quickly edit a text, write an email in a foreign language, or rephrase a message in a more formal tone knows the feeling of frustration. Stylo was born from exactly that frustration.

## Why I Started Building Stylo

The reason was simple — I needed a fast tool to edit text the way I wanted. I searched online, but nothing I found satisfied me. Existing tools were either too complex, packed with unnecessary features, or simply didn't do what I needed.

So I sat down and started thinking about what I actually wanted from such a tool. And that's how **Stylo** was born — a simple yet powerful text editing and transformation tool.

## What Stylo Can Do

Stylo saves you time and energy in your everyday work with text:

- **Grammar correction** — fixes spelling and grammar errors with one click
- **Style transformation** — converts everyday text into formal, legal, casual, or fun styles
- **Translation and foreign language writing** — write a draft email in your native language and Stylo translates and refines it into French, German, or any other language
- **Legal documents** — need to write a complaint or formal letter? Stylo handles it
- **Message replies** — generates contextual responses to emails or messages

## Real-World Use Cases

### A French Email in Under a Minute

Imagine you need to write an email in French, but your French isn't perfect. With other tools, you'd have to craft a prompt for ChatGPT or Gemini, copy the result, and possibly translate it again. With Stylo, you write a draft in your language and get a polished French email with one click.

### A Formal Complaint Without the Stress

Need to write a legal complaint or formal letter? You don't have to be a lawyer. Write what you want to say in plain language, and Stylo transforms it into a formal legal style.

## What Makes Stylo Different

Unlike ChatGPT or other AI chatbots, Stylo is a **specialized tool**. No need to invent prompts, no need to copy text between windows, no waiting for chatbot responses. Everything works simply — write your text, choose a transformation, and get the result.

## Free and For Everyone

I originally built Stylo for myself, but gradually realized that thousands of people face the same problems every day. That's why I'm committed to keeping Stylo **free for everyone**. I'm constantly working on it and developing it to serve not just me, but others as well.

In the future, if there's strong demand for Stylo, I may introduce a small fee to keep the project sustainable and growing. But I believe Stylo will find its audience.

## Try Stylo
